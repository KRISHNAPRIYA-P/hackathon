# hackathon

We came up with a project idea for leaf disease detection and to provide proper knowledge to the people working on Agricultural sector .
In this project we created a website where one can upload images of crop leaves,and the trained model process the leaf image and give an analysis(like it is healthy or not).
Now we just created a basic disease detection model by using 'Pepper' leaves , planning to add more features by considering all other factors that affects the health of crops,for example migration of insects,birds,animals, Weather change etc..

NB:The model weight files as well as the dataset used were too big and hence we could upload it. Part of the model files is provided.
